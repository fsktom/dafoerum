trying out leptos and stuff for creating a forum or wiki (not sure yet) <https://youtu.be/V1cqQRmVAK0> + 2 years ago greg with primeagen

## Development

You have to have installed:

- tailwindcss v4
- leptosfmt
- cargo-leptos
- Rust nightly with wasm32-unknown-unknown target

## General Plan

I've been thinking about what I want to do with this project. I like creating things, or rather when I see something, I'm thinking "hmm maybe I could do this too" - for learning and as a challenge etc.

This started out as a forum, but I think I'm gonna expand it to what I originally wanted to do: something akin to a private tracker with a forum, wiki, torrent listing + separately the actual torrent tracker and IRC server + user management

Absolutely huge-ass project, taking inspiration from Gazelle and UNIT3D I guess,

But sounds fun I think... or at least the little bit of fun/distraction from other things :))) ðŸ¦Š :/

For the forum aspect, maybe also take some inspiration from more modern takes like https://users.rust-lang.org/
but combine it with the old-school and clear way like the AB Forum
